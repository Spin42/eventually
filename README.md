# Eventually

Server-side application based on [Eventually Toolkit](https://github.com/Spin42/eventually_toolkit) that handle events generated by [Eventually Tracker](https://github.com/Spin42/eventually_tracker) (client-side).

## Requirements

* Redis
* PostgreSQL
* RVM
* Ruby 2.2.2

## How It Works

TODO

## Usage

Configure by filling config/application.yml

Install gems, run database migrations:

```
$ bundle && rake db:migrate
```

Create an application (that will be able to push events via the API):

```
$ rails c
> Application.create({name: "My Application", api_key: "myApiKey", api_secret: "myApiSecret"})
```

Configure Eventually Tracker to use the previous keys:

[Eventually Tracker readme](https://github.com/Spin42/eventually_tracker/blob/master/README.md)

Start projectors:

```
$ rake projectors:start[all]
```

Start data workers (if you want):

```
$ rake data_workers:perform[all]
```

Start Rails application:

```
$ rails s
```

## Deployment

The following installation is made based on the hypothesis that you are connected on a machine with a user called eventually 'eventually'. Furthermore, you need to be able to access to the tools prevouisly mentionned in the requirements section.


<!--Create an user 'eventually':

	$ rvm use ruby-2.2.2@eventually --create

Create and use a gemset 'eventually':

	$ rvm use ruby-2.2.2@eventually --create

Create a wrapper to use bundle with your previously created gemset:

	$ rvm wrapper ruby-2.2.2@eventually eventually bundle

And then execute:

    $ bundle
-->
